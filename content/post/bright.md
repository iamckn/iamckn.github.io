# Who are you?

Bright Gameli Mawudor is my name. Friends in the infosec world call me ~ze3D~. A passionate information security engineer with a love for system exploitation, gleaning information from all corners of the web about a target, and social engineering using all possible methods.

# What's your setup like?

My laptop is an 8GB memory Samsung Series 9 13.3" HD+ cruising on an Intel® Core™ i5-3317U CPU @ 1.70GHz × 4 with Intel® Ivybridge Mobile for graphics and 128 SSD storage. It's pretty thin and lightweight. 

External Storage space for me is a total of 2 Terabytes, 10GB Dropbox and 15GB on Google Drive, which is something I find very convenient.

I am running Kali linux as my primary OS and dual boot Windows 8 on the side when needed. Kali has all the tools I need for my infosec work and experiments. I also import tools from various sources.

I have a Nexus 5 phone and a Nexus 7 Generation 2 tab. I run [**Kali Nethunter**](http://www.nethunter.com/) on both, although I recently misplaced the Nexus 7. Kali Nethunter running on Android 5.0 makes it just the kind of phone to have in terms of the all purpose features.

I have a lot of interest in Wireless Networks which is one of the areas in my PhD research. For that matter, I've got a WiFi Pineapple Mark V Tactical Bundle 6800 with a 9dBi Dipole Antenna and a magnetic Base. The many features included in the WiFi Pineapple are beyond description. It makes wireless pentesting very easy if one understands the basics involved.

I have a [**USB Rubber Ducky Deluxe**](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/collections/usb-rubber-ducky/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe?variant=353378649) that I use for Red Teaming assessments and other pentests when needed. It helps a lot in grabbing passwords when close to a target's machine, and also for any other function that would take long to type manually.

# What tools do you run?

For now, Kali linux does the job on the Samsung Series 9 with it having most of the tools that I need. I clone a lot of scripts from github to complement the ones already included in the Kali linux collection. The collection keeps growing by the day. The Nexus 5 having Kali NetHunter is good enough due to its dynamic nature as I mostly like porting scripts to it from the Samsung laptop.

# What's your dream setup

Anyone in the infosec field will keep dreaming for faster equipment no matter how much they have. 
It'll be great to have some of the toys from the [**HAK5 shop**](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/) which include some radio stuff and the THROWING STAR LAN. It would also be great to have a good Rainbow table collection on an external hard drive, a [**Pwn-plug**](https://www.pwnieexpress.com/product/pwn-plug-r3penetration-testing-device/) for future pentests and a powerful blade server to host all my goodies.
