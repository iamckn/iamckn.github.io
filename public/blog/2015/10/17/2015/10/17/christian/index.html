          <p>#who are you?</p>
<p>I am a passionate Information Security enthusiast. I specialize in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Research and artifacts analysis are the cause of my sleepless nights. I have a keen interest in PC and mobile device malware, I am therefore always tinkering with VMs and mobile phones.</p>
<p>#what&rsquo;s your setup like?</p>
<p>As is the norm with geeks, i have a few toys i play around with to facilitate my research.</p>

<p>The Dell laptop is my daily driver and it runs kali linux. It has an Intel Core i5­5200U processor clocking 2.2.Ghz x 4, 4GB Nvidia GeForce 920M graphics card, 8 GB ram and 1TB of storage.
The HP Envy 15 is my research laptop, running Ubuntu desktop, it has an Intel core i7 4700MQ processor clocking 2.4Ghz x 8, 16GB RAM and 1TB of Storage.</p>
<p>I use Kali as my primary OS because of the flexibility and the tools it comes with. The Ubuntu OS comes in very handy with research, development and the analysis that i do. I also run a windows VM for my documentation needs.
My phone runs Kali nethunter with BRO IDS to keep track of traffic in and out of my phone.</p>
<p>My interest in other fields have grown over the past few years and I have slowly incorporated Wireless and HID gadgets and resources for my research, hence some of the toys I have. It is always interesting to see how different infosec disciplines integrate and complement each other to achieve a predefined set of objectives.</p>
<p>#what tools do you run?</p>
<p>The tools i run usually depend on the type of activity i am performing. The bare minimum is Santoku and REMnux for malware analysis, Kali linux for the usual infosec stuff, Security Onion for network traffic analysis, and Windows for forensic analysis and documentation.</p>
<p>#What&rsquo;s your dream setup</p>
<p>My dream setup would be three 27 inch LED monitors side by side and a powerful enough CPU for decent 50­60 fps gaming and infosec research, a multicoloured  LED backlit keyboard and gaming mouse. As for the infosec toys, a quadcopter drone bundled with a WiFi pineapple, camera module and goggles, would do it for me. I hope Santa is gonna read this blog lol.</p>
