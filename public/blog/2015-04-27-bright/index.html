          <p>#who are you?</p>
<p>Bright Gameli Mawudor is my name. Friends in the infosec world call me ~ze3D~. A passionate information security engineer with a love for system exploitation, gleaning information from all corners of the web about a target, and social engineering using all possible methods.</p>
<p>#what&rsquo;s your setup like?</p>
<p>My laptop is an 8GB memory Samsung Series 9 13.3&quot; HD+ cruising on an Intel® Core™ i5-3317U CPU @ 1.70GHz × 4 with Intel® Ivybridge Mobile for graphics and 128 SSD storage. It&rsquo;s pretty thin and lightweight.</p>
<p>External Storage space for me is a total of 2 Terabytes, 10GB Dropbox and 15GB on Google Drive, which is something I find very convenient.</p>
<p>I am running Kali linux as my primary OS and dual boot Windows 8 on the side when needed. Kali has all the tools I need for my infosec work and experiments. I also import tools from various sources.</p>
<p>I have a Nexus 5 phone and a Nexus 7 Generation 2 tab. I run <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Kali Nethunter</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> on both, although I recently misplaced the Nexus 7. Kali Nethunter running on Android 5.0 makes it just the kind of phone to have in terms of the all purpose features.</p>
<p>I have a lot of interest in Wireless Networks which is one of the areas in my PhD research. For that matter, I&rsquo;ve got a WiFi Pineapple Mark V Tactical Bundle 6800 with a 9dBi Dipole Antenna and a magnetic Base. The many features included in the WiFi Pineapple are beyond description. It makes wireless pentesting very easy if one understands the basics involved.</p>
<p>I have a <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>USB Rubber Ducky Deluxe</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> that I use for Red Teaming assessments and other pentests when needed. It helps a lot in grabbing passwords when close to a target&rsquo;s machine, and also for any other function that would take long to type manually.</p>
<p>{% img /images/bright_setup.jpg 500 100 %}</p>
<p>#what tools do you run?</p>
<p>For now, Kali linux does the job on the Samsung Series 9 with it having most of the tools that I need. I clone a lot of scripts from github to complement the ones already included in the Kali linux collection. The collection keeps growing by the day. The Nexus 5 having Kali NetHunter is good enough due to its dynamic nature as I mostly like porting scripts to it from the Samsung laptop.</p>
<p>#What&rsquo;s your dream setup</p>
<p>Anyone in the infosec field will keep dreaming for faster equipment no matter how much they have.
It&rsquo;ll be great to have some of the toys from the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>HAK5 shop</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> which include some radio stuff and the THROWING STAR LAN. It would also be great to have a good Rainbow table collection on an external hard drive, a <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Pwn-plug</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> for future pentests and a powerful blade server to host all my goodies.</p>
