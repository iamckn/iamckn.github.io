      <description>&lt;p&gt;In part three, we finally figured out how to remotely control the smart power plugs (turn them on or off). In this final part, we are going to see how inadequate security controls can be exploited for various purposes. We are also going to look at one more scenario where the smart power plugs have no internet access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In part two, we figured out how to discover the smart plugs in a network and their details. We were also able to send remote commands to ikonkek2.com and query details about specific smart plugs. This was made possible by the discovery of a hardcoded aes key used to encrypt messages. We however still cannot turn a smart plug on or off remotely. So let&amp;rsquo;s concentrate on that in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In part one, we concentrated on analysing the network communication when one turns the smart power plug on or off from the app.&#xA;We had noticed some form of encrypted/encoded communication happening on udp port 27431 between the smart plug and the app installed on the phone. We also noticed some form of encrypted/encoded communication on tcp ports 9123 and 5222(xmpp) between the app, smart plug and ikonkek2.com.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought some smart power plugs and they were pretty awesome! These are the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eques Elf smart plugs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; They can be controlled using an app through a connected Wi-Fi network, and remotely over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything was going on well till I noticed some strange urls on my home network monitoring system. It turns out it was the smart plug constantly communicating with some external hosts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Information security conference badges have rapidly evolved over time. They have become a favorite among conference organisers and attendees as fun accessories that tie in to the conference experience. Unique badges have become collectible items that attendees keep and identify with a particular conference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had a set of Intex Wireless Roaming Headphones lying around the house for a couple of years. They consist of a receiver (headphones) and a separate transmitter. The headphones include an FM receiver powered by two AAA batteries with reset and scan buttons for normal FM operation, and of course volume control. The separate transmitter comes with audio and microphone jack ports and is also powered by two AAA batteries. It also has a DC port as an alternative power source option. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
